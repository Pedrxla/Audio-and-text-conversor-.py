Hi everyone,

I'd like to present a personal project I developed to help my mom.

She didn’t feel comfortable typing on the computer keyboard, so I built a simple and intuitive voice-to-text converter that allows her to speak naturally and have everything written down automatically.

The program has a user-friendly interface with three main buttons:

Start: begins recording audio from the microphone.

Pause: pauses the recording without losing the audio.

Stop: ends the session, transcribes the audio to text using Google’s speech recognition (in Brazilian Portuguese), and saves both the text and the audio file to a folder on the desktop.

I also included basic punctuation correction, so the transcribed text is more readable, and there's even a second tab where users can open ChatGPT for more advanced editing.

It was developed in Python using libraries like tkinter, sounddevice, and speech_recognition, and it runs smoothly on any computer with Python and Java SE 17 or higher installed.

This tool made a real difference for my mom, and I'm proud to have created something meaningful and practical for her daily life.
